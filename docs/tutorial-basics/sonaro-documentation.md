# Sonaro Vaso3D Documentation

Welcome to the Sonaro Vaso3D documentation! This guide provides an overview of our backend and frontend systems, detailing their functionality, setup, and usage.

## Sonaro Vaso3D Backend API with Async Segmentation API üìÇüöÄ

The Sonaro Vaso3D backend API is designed for efficient and secure processing of ultrasound images, leveraging asynchronous task management and cloud technologies. Here‚Äôs a detailed look at its features and setup:

### Key Features

- **Asynchronous Processing**: Utilizes Celery to handle file processing tasks efficiently and asynchronously.
- **Secure File Handling**: Only accepts and delivers files via pre-signed S3 URLs, ensuring secure and controlled file access.
- **Output Generation**: Converts processed ultrasound images into 3D STL files and MP4 videos representing the ultrasound sweep.
- **Cloud Deployment**: Deployed on AWS EC2 using Docker with GPU support for intensive tasks and NGINX for routing and HTTPS.
- **Token Validation**: Routes are protected by JWT tokens from Cognito, ensuring secure access.

### Installation

**Prerequisites**:

- Python 3.10
- Docker and Docker Compose
- NVIDIA Driver with CUDA support

**Docker Setup**:

1. Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed on your machine.
2. Build and run Docker containers for local development:

   ```bash
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up --build
   ```

3. For deployment on EC2, use the EC2-specific Docker Compose configuration:

   ```bash
   docker-compose -f docker-compose-ec2.yml up --build
   ```

4. Configure the `.env.docker-ec2` file for production deployment.

**Additional Setup**:

- Install the `pose-regularization` library:

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/IFL-CAMP/pose_regularization.git
  cd pose_regularization/python
  python setup.py install
  ```

### Usage

Run the backend API using Docker. Ensure the correct configuration for local development or EC2 deployment as described above. For a detailed API reference, access the Swagger UI at [http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs](http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs).

## Vaso3D Web App üåêüñ•Ô∏è

The Vaso3D Web App provides a seamless user experience for interacting with the backend system, featuring a modern, React-based frontend. Here‚Äôs an overview:

### Key Features

- **Secure Authentication**: Handles user login and authentication via Cognito.
- **Dashboard**: Central hub for managing patient records, uploading files, and viewing results.
- **Patient Management**: Facilitates the addition and management of patient information.
- **File Uploading**: Upload ultrasound files for processing and view the results.
- **Results**: Displays 3D reconstructions and videos of ultrasound sweeps.
- **Admin Page**: Admin interface for managing users and invitations.

### Getting Started

**Prerequisites**:

- Node.js (Install from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/))

**Installation**:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sonaro-ai/Vaso3D-web-app.git
   cd Vaso3D-web-app
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables by creating a `.env` file with the following content:

   ```env
   VITE_SONARO_APP_FIREBASE_KEY=___xxx___
   VITE_SONARO_AWS_CLIENT_ID=___xxx___
   VITE_SONARO_AWS_USERPOOL_ID=___xxx___
   VITE_AWS_REGION=___xxx___
   VITE_S3_BUCKET_NAME=___xxx___
   ```

4. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

**Technology Stack**:

- **React**: For building user interfaces.
- **TypeScript**: Adds type safety to JavaScript.
- **Vite**: Provides a fast development environment.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Offers utility-first CSS for custom designs.
- **React Router**: Manages routing within the app.
- **Axios**: Handles HTTP requests.
